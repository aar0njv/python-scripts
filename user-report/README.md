# 🖥️ User Login Report Script

This Python script tracks which users are currently logged into which machines based on login and logout events. I created this script as a part of the Python Crash Course associated with Google IT Automations with Python Course in Coursera

## 🔧 How It Works

- Takes a list of events with login/logout info.
- Sorts the events by date.
- Tracks which users are logged into each machine.
- Prints a report showing currently logged-in users.
